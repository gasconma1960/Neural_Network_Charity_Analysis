# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## **Overview of the analysis**: 
 With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

 From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization

## **Results**: 
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

   - **Data Preprocessing**
      - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
      - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
        - APPLICATION_TYPE
        - AFFILIATION
        - CLASSIFICATION
        - USE_CASE
        - ORGANIZATION
        - STATUS
        - INCOME_AMT
        - SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
        - ASK_AMT
      - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
        - EIN 
        - NAME
  - **Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**
       - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
       - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
       - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
